For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Build all designs with attention to aesthetics, usability, and production-readiness. Avoid generic or cookie-cutter layoutsâ€”create interfaces that are beautiful, distinctive, and fully functional.

This project uses JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not include additional UI libraries, icon packs, or component frameworks unless explicitly requested.

Always use Lucide React for icons, including logos, unless stated otherwise.

When building components or screens intended for mobile applications, assume a React Native or Expo-based environment. Use React Native-compatible patterns and Tailwind-compatible syntax (e.g., NativeWind or Tailwind RN). Avoid web-only features unless the target is explicitly the web.

Prioritize clean, modular, and reusable code. Name components clearly, use functional patterns, and follow accessibility best practices. Ensure all designs are responsive and adapt well to different screen sizes.

Assume dark mode as default unless specified otherwise.
